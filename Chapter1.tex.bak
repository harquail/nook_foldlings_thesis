\section{Rooted in history ... improving the present ... shaping the future}

Founded in 1867 by Dartmouth alumnus Sylvanus Thayer, Thayer School is one of the country's oldest professional schools of engineering. General Thayer believed that engineering in the context of a liberal arts education could provide the single best preparation for addressing the world's problems. This wisdom remains at the core of Thayer School's educational mission.

Undergraduate students are grounded in the liberal arts and rooted in the humanities. Their engineering sciences major is part of the Dartmouth Bachelor of Arts program, and many of them integrate their engineering work with other sciences or even studio art.

Graduate students take a range of courses as they develop advanced professional skills. They tackle research problems that may take them into any field of engineering or into areas that draw on several disciplines.

Dartmouth engineering students are preparing themselves for major roles in placing engineering skills in service of society.

\section{Setting the stage for innovation}

There is only one engineering department—Thayer School itself. When expertise from across the engineering disciplines converges, the opportunities for groundbreaking innovation increase exponentially. An intense spirit of teamwork and camaraderie is a hallmark of Thayer School. Shared ideas, shared challenges, and shared inspiration push our faculty and students to solve global problems with unparalleled enthusiasm and commitment.
