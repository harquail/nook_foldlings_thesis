#Interactions

Through the iterations described in the previous chapter, we arrived at Foldlings' tool-based system for card design.

## Tool Interactions

Some interactions are common to all features.  To add a feature, you select the tool that creates features of that type.  Each feature type^[(Except for the master card)] has a corresponding button in the toolbar at the bottom of the sketches.  In general, all features are defined by dragging in the drawing area.  Features are generally completed by releasing the drag.  As long as you remain in that tool, you can continue creating features of that type by dragging.  Having consistent tool interactions helps reduce the burden of learning new tools, and allows for a scaffolded user experience. **>>TODO cite scaffolding lit**

### Box Fold

A box fold is created by dragging.

### FreeForm

Drag, then truncate automatically

### Polygon

Tap to add points or drag
Special case, tap within poly with poly tool selected doesn't add points 

### V-Fold

two-step feature
vertical cut, then drag on driving fold

##Tutorial

We eschewed detailed drawing instructions or a separate tutorial mode, in favor of short video tutorials that appear the first time each tool is used.  These tutorials can also be accessed by tapping the feature icons on the about page.

We also show helpful tips between screens â€” for example, when moving to 3D preview and restoring from a saved sketch.  

##Warnings and Errors

We display warnings and errors as bright-red banners at the top of the sketch view when. These warnings are displayed in response to failing the validity checks performed when adding a feature to the sketch.

The goal of these warnings is to give users descriptive feedback when errors occur, and to give them an intuitive sense of which actions create invalid features.

##Send to Laser Cutter

In the three-dimensional preview, users can tap the "send to laser cutter" option.  This feature sends the user an email with an attached SVG file.  This file can be fed to a laser cutter or paper cutting machine, or can be opened in a vector graphics program to make further changes.

##Print

In addition to sharing an SVG file for laser cutting, users can press "share".  This version is essentially screenshot of the 2D sketch, and can be printed, emailed, or shared via social media.  Typically, this is the option a user would choose to cut and fold their design by hand.
