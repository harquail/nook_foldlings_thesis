#Final User Study

As a final test of software, we compared the usability with Foldlings to traditional manual popup design methods.  First, we presented participants with a completed popup card, and asked them to replicate the design using manual cutting and folding and to create the design using our software.  The order was randomized, so half of participants were given were given the manual first, and half started with Foldlings.  We timed how long the participants took to complete the design.  Next, we gave them a free-form exercise: make a design that includes a tree."  Finally, we asked participants to rate the experience of using our tool and their satisfaction with the popup card  they produced.   >>TODO: attach image >>TODO graphs, data, participants, do the study lol
