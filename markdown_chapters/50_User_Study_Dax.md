\chapter{User Studies}

While we performed frequent informal tests of our software with users, these often consisted of a single user.  The user tests described in this chapter were larger-scale tests of key pieces of our software, and were a major driving force in our design process.

#User Test at the	 Digital Arts Exhibition

On April 28, 2015, we tested our system with attendees of the Digital Arts Exhibition at Dartmouth. After a brief demonstration of how to create folds and preview their design, users designed cards using Foldlings.  Users drew sketches, and then sent an email containing an SVG file to the computer connected to the laser cutter.  Finally, they placed a piece of paper in the laser cutter, and watched as the laser beam cut out their design.  Over the course of two hours, users cut and folded 31 popup cards. 

The system we demonstrated at the exhibition was incomplete — it contained the basic box fold and freeform shape tools, but did not include some advanced features of the final software, such as dragging folds or shading based on plane orientation.  The alpha software also contained several bugs that disrupted the experience.  However, the system was usable enough for people to create cards, and observing user behavior was invaluable in designing our final product.

Because users were new to our system — and constrained by the pressure of other users waiting to design cards — designs were relatively simple. Sketches generally contained between two and five fold features in addition to the base card — the most complex design contained ten fold features.  Despite their simplicity, sketches showed a wide range of designs, ranging from abstract shapes to representational scenes — users sketched symbols, Chinese characters, and geometric forms.  Most of the sketches utilized both freeform and box fold features, mixing the two element types to create a composition.  One of the most popular design elements was the user’s name: 5 of the cards contained names or initials.  Roughly one third of the designs took advantage of nesting — constructing fold features inside each other.  

Because users were able to quickly design and fabricate their design, people generally left satisfied.  People typically spent around 20 minutes at our booth, leaving with a popup card they had created.  However, the experience was not frictionless. Users were frustrated by crashes: touching the screen with more than one finger or drawing while calculating planes were the most common reasons for failure.  Other common complaints were the lack of a delete/undo button and that the UI did not show which tool was currently selected.

Folding the fabricated design also presented difficulties.  Although they were able to see a 3D preview of their design while creating it, users had often relinquished the iPad by the time they folded their design.  They were often unsure how to fold their card, and struggled to discover the correct fold orientations.  In some cases, it took longer for users to fold their creation than to design it.

We observed several unexpected behaviors.  A few users rotated the screen to design a card in a landscape view, rather than the portrait orientation implied by the orientation of the buttons and 3D preview.  They used this orientation to design cards that folded medially rather than laterally.  Several users also constructed overlapping features by drawing on top of existing features.  These features did not simulate correctly, as they intersected with existing edges.  However, this behavior demonstrated a desire to construct more complex geometry.  In the final software we implement unions for fold features  — the most recently-drawn feature occludes features underneath it, modifying their edges.  

Users also relied on the 3D preview to differing degrees.  Some users viewed the preview after every operation, while others only switched to the preview occasionally. Many users relied on the 3D preview as a reference to how to fold their popup card. We were surprised by this, and conducted further user studies to determine the effectiveness of methods of displaying 3D information.
