#Intersections Between Features

![An attempted sketch with overlapping features.](figures/91_Appendix_DAX_Creations/overlapping_features.png)

As we observed at the Digital Arts Exhibition^[See section chapter **>>TODO**], users often attempt to draw features that overlap with existing features in the sketch. 


Our intersection .  This is a complex problem, and is only partly implemented^[One ] due to the complexity involved in adding intersections to our system.  Currently, we display an error message if the intersected feature will be left with any folds less than the minimum edge length.  A more complete implementation would .
