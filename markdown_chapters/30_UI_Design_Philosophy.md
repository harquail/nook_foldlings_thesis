#Design Philosophy

Our design philosophy is simple: follow the user.  As often as possible, we presented our interface concepts to potential users, and allowed their feedback to guide the design process through the final prototype.

Following a methodology roughly following agile methodologies, we designed and developed the application collaboratively (@martin2003agile).  Our process was driven by user experience design, rather than graphic design.  That is, we spent relatively little time polishing aesthetic interface details, and instead focussed on the core interactions of the application.

mention affordances of iPad â€” cite Gibson/teapot guy.  We chose to design for the iPad as a way of forcing the interface.  With a simple, gesture-based interface, we were forced to 

Throughout the design process, we explored the conflict between creativity and rigid geometric constraints.  That is, interfaces that give the user more room for creative generally tend to make it more difficult to create designs that will fold correctly in 3D.  We aimed for an interface that provides a great deal of flexibility and creativity, while guaranteeing that all popup card designs created with it are valid.  Two primary systems maintain this balance. 

1) Tool-based feature creation allows for complex geometry while solving geometric constraints transparently.
2) The validity system disallows geometry that would interfere with existing design elements.

We strive to design an interface that is **modular**, **friendly**, and **delightful**.  **Modularity** stems from the conception of the pop-up card as a collection of discrete units that can be acted on individually.  Modularity allows users to think in terms of shape constructions, without concern for individual cuts and folds.  Users can modify, add, and delete individual geometric units, without modifying the majority of their design.  **Friendliness** is seen in the careful structuring of our experience to make getting started as painless as possible.  For example, we structure our tutorial not as a step that must be completed before using the app, but as a series of brief videos that appear when using a tool for the first time.  **Delight** comes from small, unexpected details that enhance the user experience.  For example, our color scheme for planes is inspired by the colors of construction paper.  Through this color scheme, we hope to evoke the spirit of fun and exploration associated with casual paper-craft.
