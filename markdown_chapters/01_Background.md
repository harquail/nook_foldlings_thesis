introduce kirigami, then popup cards, then maybe trees/graphs?

Kirigami is the art of papercraft originating from 17th century Japan @temko1978magic.  In contrast with origami, which only permits folds, kirigami designs incorporate cuts.  In particular, Foldlings is concerned with 90-degree pop-up cards, which have the further constraint that orthogonal relationships exist between planes.  As a further restriction, we do not use glue or other attachment in building pop-up cards.  All designs are cut from a single piece of paper, in the tradition of kirigami @temko1978magic.

The 90-degree popup card presents a tightly-constrained problem, with opportunities for both interface design and algorithm innovations.
