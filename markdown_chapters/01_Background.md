introduce kirigami, then popup cards, then maybe trees/graphs?

Kirigami is the art of papercraft originating from 17th century Japan @temko1978magic.  In contrast with origami, which only permits folds, kirigami designs incorporate cuts.  Thus, kirigami can represent a wide range of 2D and 3D constructions.  For example,  — as long as the design was.  Further constraints define subsets of kirigami.    In particular, Foldlings is concerned with 90-degree pop-up cards, which have the further constraint that orthogonal relationships exist between planes.  We do not use glue or other attachment in building pop-up cards; all designs are cut from a single piece of paper, in the tradition of kirigami (@temko1978magic).

The 90-degree popup card presents a tightly-constrained problem, with opportunities for both interface design and algorithm innovations. We present a system for designing popup cards, whose audience is deliberately broad.   We aim to make the pop-up card design process easier and more fun.

Typically, users create popup cards through manual methods.  For example, a user might sketch out shape on a card in pencil, and then measure with a rule to find locations to place folds.  Or, they might fold the paper while cutting, discovering correct fold positions experimentally.  The second method works well for simple designs, but becomes difficult with complex and nested geometries^[These are behaviors we observed by watching users create pop-up cards.].  Constructing popup cards manually presents sever problems:
