introduce kirigami, then popup cards, then maybe trees/graphs?

Kirigami is the art of papercraft originating from 17th century Japan @temko1978magic.  In contrast with origami, which only permits folds, kirigami designs incorporate cuts.  Thus, kirigami can represent a wide range of 2D.  Further    In particular, Foldlings is concerned with 90-degree pop-up cards, which have the further constraint that orthogonal relationships exist between planes.  We do not use glue or other attachment in building pop-up cards; all designs are cut from a single piece of paper, in the tradition of kirigami @temko1978magic.

The 90-degree popup card presents a tightly-constrained problem, with opportunities for both interface design and algorithm innovations. We present a system for designing popup cards, whose audience is deliberately broad.   We aim to make the pop=up card design process easier and more fun.

Typically, users create popup cards through manual methods.  For example, a user might sketch out shape on a card in pencil, and then measure with a rule to find locations to place folds.  Or, they might ^[These are behaviors we observed by watching users create pop-up cards.]
