We plan to release Foldlings in the Apple app store in September.  In many ways, the primary test of our software will be the extent to which real users are able to achieve their design goals.  However, we can make several conclusions about the success of our tool.  **>>TODO: reference final user study**.  Additionally, we have qualitative evidence.  That said, there is much 

#User Interface Future Work

##Multiple Cards

Currently,

##Modifications to the Master Card

Currently, our software only allows for one size of master 

#Algorithms & Implementation Future Work

##Feature Intersections

Feature intersections are only partially implemented, and are

A key limitation of Foldlings is that all functions currently run on a single thread.  As a consequence, the user is sometimes blocked by operations

#Potential Applications

As a general-purpose kirigami design tool, Foldlings has a wide variety of potential applications.
