#Tool Implementation

Below is the definition of the FoldFeature superclass â€” all features created using Foldlings can override these methods to provide specific functionality.  The , and.  It also contains several functions that   For further discussion of the FoldFeature data structure, see **>>TODO cite**.

\begin{pygmented}{swift}
var horizontalFolds:[Edge] = [] //list of horizontal folds
var featureEdges:[Edge]?        //edges in a feature
var children:[FoldFeature] = [] // children of feature
var drivingFold:Edge? // driving fold of feature
var parent:FoldFeature? // parent of feature
var startPoint:CGPoint?
var endPoint:CGPoint? // start and end touch points

/// splits an edge around the current feature
func splitFoldByOcclusion(edge:Edge) -> [Edge]
{
//by default, return edge whole
return [edge]
}
/// features are leaves if they don't have children
func isLeaf() -> Bool
{
return children.count == 0
}
/// options or modifications that can be made to the current feature
func tapOptions() -> [FeatureOption]?
{
  return [FeatureOption.PrintPlanes, FeatureOption.PrintEdges,
  FeatureOption.ColorPlaneEdges, FeatureOption.PrintSinglePlane]
}
/// whether a feature is drawn over a fold, determines whether 
/// a fold can be the driving fold for a feature
  func featureSpansFold(fold:Edge)->Bool
{
  return false
}
/// returns and calculates planes in a feature
func getFeaturePlanes()-> [Plane]{
  return featurePlanes
}
/// whether a feature contains a point
/// needs to be overridden by subclasses
func containsPoint(point:CGPoint) -> Bool{
  return self.boundingBox()?.contains(point) ?? false
}
\end{pygmented}

Of the functions, the most complex are \textIt{featureSpansFold} and \textIt{splitFoldByOcclusion}

### FreeForm

**>>TODO DISCUSSION OF SPLITTING**
talk about splitting algorithm.  Recursively subdivide

catmull rom curves
However, the catmull-Rom algorithm only draws a full path when the start and end points of the curve are coincident.  We use an alpha value of 1.0, which we found to be the closest to the intended touch shape through informal user studies. 

talk about truncation

talk about bitmap intersection

We capture interpolation points as a function of touch velocity.  That is, when the user draws more quickly, we capture more interpolation points closer together.  This allows us to capture the entire drawing with a similar level of detail throughout, and correct for the gesture recognizer sending relatively more frequent updates when the touch is moving more slowly.

### Polygon

Polygons are very similar to freeform shapes.  The main difference between polygon and freeform shapes is that the intersection tests for polygons are much cheaper.  For intersections between.

The interpolation points are vertices

contrast with free-form
talk about point dragging 

The algorithm for truncating polygons is similar to that, except that intersection tests are much cheaper.

##Self-intersecting Paths

In order to be rendered by SceneKit in 3D, paths cannot have self intersections.  Thus, we attempt to repair self-intersecting paths when adding features to the sketch.  

\begin{algorithm}[H]
 \KwData{this text}
 \KwResult{how to write algorithm with \LaTeX2e }
 initialization\;
 \While{not at end of this document}{
  read current\;
  \eIf{understand}{
   go to next section\;
   current section becomes this one\;
   }{
   go back to the beginning of current section\;
  }
 }
 \caption{Self-intersecting path repair}
\end{algorithm}

**>>TODO: ALGO**

segments <- discretize bezier path into line segments, using adaptive subdivision.
i <- 0
for (int i = 0; i < segments.length; i++){
//compare with segment after current segment
for (int j = 0; j = i; j++){
if(segments[i] intersects segments[j]{
   remove segments[i..j]
	i = j //skip segments in between intersection point
}
}



A convoluted design with many overlapping self intersections can fail to resolve to a valid shape.  In cases where out algorithm fails, we display an error and do not add the feature to the sketch.
