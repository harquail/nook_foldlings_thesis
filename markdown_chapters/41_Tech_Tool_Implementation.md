#Tool Implementation

Below is the definition of the FoldFeature superclass â€” all features created using Foldlings can override these methods to provide specific functionality.  The , and.  It also contains several functions that   For further discussion of the FoldFeature data structure, see **>>TODO cite**.

\begin{pygmented}{swift}
var horizontalFolds:[Edge] = [] //list of horizontal folds
var featureEdges:[Edge]?        //edges in a feature
var children:[FoldFeature] = [] // children of feature
var drivingFold:Edge? // driving fold of feature
var parent:FoldFeature? // parent of feature
var startPoint:CGPoint?
var endPoint:CGPoint? // start and end touch points

/// splits an edge around the current feature

{

return children.count == 0
}

Of these functions, the most complex are _featureSpansFold_ and _splitFoldByOcclusion_.  _FeatureSpansFold_ is implemented depending on

### FreeForm

A freeform shape consists of a series of interpolation points through which a we construct a bezier curve using the Catmull-Rom algorithm.  **>>TODO:CITE** We capture interpolation points as a function of touch velocity.  That is, when the user draws more quickly, we capture more interpolation points closer together.  This allows us to capture the entire drawing with a similar level of detail throughout, and correct for the gesture recognizer sending relatively more frequent updates when the touch is moving more slowly.

However, the catmull-Rom algorithm only draws a full path when the start and end points of the curve are coincident.  We use an alpha value of 1.0, which we found to be the closest to the intended touch shape through informal user studies. 



When a freeform shape has a driving fold, we must add

repeat \textit{scanline} operation from bottom to find bottom fold
 	
calculate middle fold position
	
\textit{folds} $\leftarrow$ top, middle, and bottom folds

\end{algorithm}

talk about bitmap intersection for scanline



Essentially, we use a bitmap approximation of the intersection point between bezier paths, because calculating intersections between arbitrary curves is computationally more expensive. We use this fast approximation to .  

**>>TODO DISCUSSION OF SPLITTING**
talk about splitting algorithm.  Recursively subdivide


### Polygon

Polygons are very similar to freeform shapes.  The main difference between polygon and freeform shapes is that the intersection tests for polygons are much cheaper.  For intersections between polygons, we can use a simple system of equations, rather than the bitmap intersection technique described above.

The interpolation points are vertices of the polygon


### V-Fold

Geometric constraints as described in
angle calculation, path splitting 

##Self-intersecting Paths

In order to be rendered by SceneKit in 3D, paths cannot have self intersections.  Thus, we attempt to repair self-intersecting paths when adding features to the sketch.  Self intersections occur in two ways: the user creates a self-intersecting path, or paths self-intersect as a result of imprecision in performing intersections or capturing touch interpolation points.

\begin{algorithm}[H]

 \textit{segments} $\leftarrow$ bezier path discretized into straight line segments using adaptive subdivision 
 
 \textit{sanitizedSegments} $\leftarrow$ empty array
  
 \For{\textit{i} $\leftarrow$ 0; \textit{i} < \textit{segments}.length; \textit{i}++}{

//compare with all segments after current segment

\For{\textit{j}  $\leftarrow$ \textit{i}; \textit{j} < \textit{segments}.length; \textit{j}++}{

\If{\textit{segments}[\textit{i}] intersects \textit{segments}[\textit{j}]}{

	remove \textit{segments}[\textit{i}..\textit{j}] from path

	\textit{i} $\leftarrow$ \textit{j}  //skip segments inbetween intersecting segments, thereby repairing the "loop"

}

\textit{sanitizedSegments}.append(\textit{segments}[\textit{i}])

}

}
 
 \Return{sanitizedSegments} \
 
\caption{Self-intersecting path repair}
\end{algorithm}


A convoluted design with many overlapping self intersections can fail to resolve to a valid shape.  In cases where our algorithm fails, we display an error and do not add the feature to the sketch.
