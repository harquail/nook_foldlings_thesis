#Tool Implementation

Below is the definition of the FoldFeature superclass â€” all features created using Foldlings can override these methods to provide specific functionality.  The , and.  It also contains several functions that   For further discussion of the FoldFeature data structure, see **>>TODO cite**.

### FreeForm

talk about splitting
catmull rom curves

However, the catmull-Rom algorithm only draws a full path when the start and end points of the curve are coincident.  We use an alpha value of 1.0, which we found to be the closest to the intended touch shape through informal user studies. 

talk about truncation

We capture interpolation points as a function of touch velocity.  That is, when the user draws more quickly, we capture more interpolation points closer together.  This allows us to capture the entire drawing with a similar level of detail throughout, and correct for the gesture recognizer sending relatively more frequent updates when the touch is moving more slowly.

### Polygon

Polygons are very similar to freeform shapes.  The main difference between polygon and freeform shapes is that the intersection tests for polygons are much cheaper.  For intersections between.

The interpolation points are vertices
