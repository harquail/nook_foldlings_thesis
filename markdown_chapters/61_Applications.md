#Potential Applications

As a general-purpose design tool for cuts and folds, Foldlings has a wide variety of potential applications.
For example, Melina Blees et al present a graphene transistor that is constructed through kirigami methods @blees2014graphene.  Simple, usable interfaces for designing complex kirigami structures are needed to advance similar research.
 
One exciting application of Foldlings is as a tool for developing advanced spatial reasoning skills.  Taylor et al present a curriculum that uses popup card design as a tool for building mathematics and spatial reasoning skills @taylor2013think3d @olson_mathematics_2004.  A tool like Foldlings would likely increase the effectiveness of such a program, since much of the experimentation could happen more quickly in software than using manual methods.  Because our code is open source, advanced students could even modify our software to develop new fold features and interactions.
