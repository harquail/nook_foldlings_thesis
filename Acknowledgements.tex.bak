I owe a large part of this thesis to the mentors, family, and friends that have supported and enriched my four years at the Thayer School.

I first wish to thank my advisor Professor Ulf \"{O}sterberg. Ulf's constant reminders of enthusiasm and persistence were instrumental in helping me traverse the rougher seas inherent to scientific research. I feel especially indebted to him for providing me with the opportunity to examine a multifaceted research topic. It has undoubtedly pushed me to become a better scientist.

I extend my most sincere thanks to Professor Elsa Garmire. It was a privilege to listen to her advice on all aspects of scientific research during the last four years. I will carry her advice for years to come.

I wish to thank Professor Brian Pogue for shaping my vision of an exemplary researcher, professor and mentor. His willingness and seemingly constant availability to discuss career and research directions are immensely appreciated.

A large portion of the experimental work described in this thesis could not have occurred without the invaluable help and advice of Marc Currie from the Naval Research Laboratory. Marc's attention to detail is a model for all experimentalists, and I consider myself lucky to have had the opportunity to work with him in the laboratory.

I wish to thank Professor Eric Hansen for serving on my thesis committee and reinvigorating my interest in teaching. I could only hope to one day have his ability to distill and teach material with the same clarity and enthusiasm.

A very special thanks goes to Ellen Stein for insuring that I make the most out of my time at the Thayer School. I am especially grateful for her objective guidance during the organization of our Common Good Day pilot.

I wish to thank Kerry Landers for her invaluable career advice, and support for my community events at North Park Graduate Housing.

The past four years would not have been the same without the friendships I developed at Dartmouth. Thanks to Jonathan Bessette for his humor and support, Dax Kepshire for great days on the slopes, Colin and Katie Carpenter for their constant laughter, Phillip and Emily Perri\~{n}ez for sharing good moments, Phaneendra Yalavarthy for discussions about research and the Canadian tree, Jenna Pollock for memorable bond fires in Norwich, Michael Hopkins for vivifying my social life in both Hanover and New York City, and Michael Miller for supporting my first attempts at half marathons and discussing everything from music to baseball innings.

The support of my friends from home were essential in helping me surmount the more difficult moments of graduate school. Many thanks go to my friend Jolene Donatelli for her honest advice and fascinating storytelling, No\'{e}mi Gagnon-Oosterwaal for her empathy during our simultaneous PhD experiences, and Andrew Mumford for reminding me that life extends beyond scientific research.

Last but certainly not least, I thank deeply my mother Mich\`{e}le Atkinson, father Herb Lukofsky, brother Adam Lukofsky and sister Risa Lukofsky for their unconditional love and support.
