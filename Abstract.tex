\end{center}
Crafting a 3D paper pop-up can be a lot of fun, and can help develop spatial reasoning skills.  However, designing the cuts and folds is often a frustrating trial and error process.  Foldlings is an iPad application that assists in this exploratory process.   Our tool-based approach allows users of all skill levels to create complex cards with ease, separating folding geometries into logical units.  This thesis focusses on the user interface and algorithms used in creating the two-dimensional view of the popup card from user input.
Our approach uses a modular set of tools, which can be combined to create complex designs.  Our systems guarantees the validity of the folded card at all stages of design, and our interface provides an intuitive set of visual aids to help users visualize the relationship between 2D patterns and 3D geometry.
