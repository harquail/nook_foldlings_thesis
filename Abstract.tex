\end{center}
Crafting a 3D paper pop-up can be a lot of fun, and can help develop spatial reasoning skills.  However, designing the cuts and folds is often a frustrating trial and error process.  Foldlings is an iPad application that assists in this exploratory process.   Our tool-based approach allows users of all skill levels to create complex cards with ease, separating folding geometries into logical units.  This thesis focusses on the user interface and algorithms used in creating the two-dimensional view of the popup card from user input.
