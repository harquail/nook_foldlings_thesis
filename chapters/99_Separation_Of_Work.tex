\section{Appendix D: Separation of
Work}\label{appendix-d-separation-of-work}

This project is a collaboration between Marissa Allen and Nook Harquail.
Although we worked collaboratively on the software, each of us presents
an individual thesis paper. Our responsibilities on the software were as
follows: Nook concentrated on tools and interactions, including
performing user studies and processing user input, while Marissa
concentrated on implementing the 3D simulation and data structures,
including methods to define and render planes in 2D and 3D.
