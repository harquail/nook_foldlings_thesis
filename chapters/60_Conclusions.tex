\chapter{Conclusions}

We plan to release Foldlings in the Apple app store in September. In
many ways, the primary test of our software will be the extent to which
real users are able to achieve their design goals. However, we can make
several conclusions about the success of our tool.
\textbf{\textgreater{}\textgreater{}TODO: reference final user study}.
Additionally, we have qualitative evidence. That said, there is much

\subsection{Modifications to the Master
Card}\label{modifications-to-the-master-card}

Currently, our software only allows for one size of master

\section{Algorithms \& Implementation Future
Work}\label{algorithms-implementation-future-work}

\subsection{Feature Intersections}\label{feature-intersections}

Feature intersections are only partially implemented, and are

\subsection{Concurrency}\label{concurrency}

A key limitation of Foldlings is that all functions currently run on a
single thread. As a consequence, the user is sometimes blocked by
operations

\section{Potential Applications}\label{potential-applications}

As a general-purpose kirigami design tool, Foldlings has a wide variety
of potential applications.
