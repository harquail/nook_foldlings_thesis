goal: test whether users understand the mapping of 2d fold patterns to
3d, and test the degree to which plane coloring, edge patterning, and a
3d preview help users understand how a popup card will fold.

Each subject receives a set of laser cut cards, and we record the time
it takes them to successfully fold the card. For each card, each subject
was randomly given one of of the following five aids: 1) A
two-dimensional design, showing planes shaded by whether they will be
horizontal or vertical when folded. 2) A two-dimensional design, with
edges patterned based on whether they are ``hills'' or ``valleys'' ---
whether they fold towards or away from the card. 3) A video showing a
simulation of the card folding in three dimensions. 4) A still image of
the card folded in dimension. 5) No visual aid.

The order of aids was shuffled, so that , and with an equal distribution
of orderings

The effect each type of aid has on folding time will help determine
which types of visualization to include in Foldlings
