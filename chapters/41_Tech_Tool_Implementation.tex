\section{Tool Implementation}\label{tool-implementation}

Below is the definition of the FoldFeature superclass --- all features
created using Foldlings can override these methods to provide specific
functionality. For further discussion of the FoldFeature data structure,
see \textbf{\textgreater{}\textgreater{}TODO cite}.
