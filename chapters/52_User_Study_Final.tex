\section{Final User Study}\label{final-user-study}

As a final test of software, we compared the usability with Foldlings to
traditional manual popup design methods. First, we presented
participants with a completed popup card, and asked them to replicate
the design using manual cutting and folding and to create the design
using our software. The order was randomized, so half of participants
were given were given the manual first, and half started with Foldlings.
We timed how long the participants took to complete the design. Next, we
gave them a free-form exercise: make a design that includes a tree."
Finally, we asked participants to rate the experience of using our tool
and their satisfaction with the popup card they produced.
