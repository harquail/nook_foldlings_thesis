We started development in Fall 2014, as the final project for a course
on Computational Fabrication at Dartmouth. By December 2014, we had a
functional prototype of our popup card design software: users could
create cuts and folds and fabricate them using a laser cutter. However,
in many ways our software was no better than manually creating cards. In
order to create a valid and beautiful design, users needed some prior
knowledge of the geometric constraints described in Chapter 3, section
\ref{constraints-on-fold-features} \ref{geometric-constraints},
\nameref{geometric-constraints}, on page
\pageref{geometric-constraints}. Performance problems also hampered
users' ability to create designs. Our goal was to improve both of these
aspects of Foldlings dramatically, to arrive at an intuitive and
functional tool. Paper mockups were an integral part of our design
process. We used these paper mockups to drive interface development, and
also to quickly get feedback from users before investing development
resources\footnote{See Appendix X: for samples of paper mockups we
  created during the design process}.

In arriving at our final design, we iterated through several potential
designs, each time getting feedback through informal user studies. We
made many changes to the toolset and experience based on feedback from
users. The final approach is ``feature-based'' --- in other words, the
user creates multiple cuts and folds in a single action, rather than
individually. These discrete logical units allow the user to design more
quickly, and to combine multiple different feature types to create
complex designs. A key advantage to this design over a less structured
approach is modularity. This is both an algorithmic and an interface
advantage: our algorithms benefit from collecting cuts and folds into
discrete logical units, and the user benefits from a faster and more
structured design process.

Throughout the development process, we collected feedback through
informal user tests. One test we performed involved presenting a
partially-implemented version of our software to users. The majority of
buttons were functional --- erase, cut, fold, and tab, but our interface
also contained buttons for unimplemented features. The primary goals
were to test whether our existing tools were useful and to collect
feedback on potential new features for Foldlings. When a user tapped a
button that we had not yet implemented, we asked them to describe how
they thought the tool would work, and talked with them about the
behavior the button represented.

\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[%

\addplot coordinates {(new sketch,14)(saved sketch,15)(erase,15)(fold,16)(cut,16)(tab,14)(track,10)(mirror,13)(send to laser,16)(print,16)};
\addplot[color=black] coordinates {(wanted mirror,12)(wanted track,2)(wanted slider,2)};

\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

In the graph above, the first ten labels indicate the number of
participants who tapped a button. The last three labels --- starting
with ``wanted mirror,'' show responses to unimplemented tools. To
calculate these numbers, we asked first users to describe what they
thought the button would do, and then gauged their reaction as we
described our vision for that tool. The tally represents a qualitative
measure of whether the user was enthusiastic about the feature or had a
more negative response. Some negative responses include confusion about
the tool's purpose and statements such as ``I don't think I would want
to use that.''

The unimplemented tools were:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Mirror: a tool that would take an existing group of edges and reflect
  them across a fold in the sketch
\item
  Track: a tool that would create a cut in the sketch, and a second
  shape that would move within the cut, with folded tabs on the opposite
  side of the card. This tool required multiple pieces of paper.
\item
  Slider: a tool that would create a parallel set of cuts, making a
  ``pocket'' that a second shape would slide through. This tool required
  multiple pieces of paper.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these tools was inspired by features often found in
commercially-designed popup cards and popup books
(\citet{birmingham1997pop} and \citet{valenta1997pop}).

From this test, we learned that the track and slider tools were
confusing, and that novice users were generally not interested in
creating features that require multiple pieces of paper.

As users created sketches using our software, we also took notes on
their experience and collected suggestions for improvements. Although
only a small fraction of the features requested by users are implemented
in the final application, the feedback from these early user tests set
us on the path toward feature-based design. A common theme among the
observations in Table 2.1 is the difficulty in creating valid sketches
and confusion about the proposed track and slider tools.

A common theme among the feature requests was a desire for a more
complete tutorial and explanation of tools. Features only appear once in
Table 2.2, even if they were requested by multiple people. The
most-requested feature was an interactive tutorial, requested by 4 (of
16) users. In the final version of our software, we display short
example videos when users use a tool for the first time. See Chapter 2,
section \ref{tool-interactions} \ref{tutorial} \nameref{tutorial} on
page \pageref{tutorial} for more discussion. These tutorials allow users
to get started quickly, with minimal interruption. In addition, a
commonality between our observations of user behavior and the feature
requests is a desire for more guidance in creating valid cards. This
indicates that the geometric constraints of popup cards were not
sufficiently intuitive or discoverable in this version of Foldlings.

As a result of this and other informal user tests, we modified our
software based on user feedback. One of the key findings from this early
test was that our toolset was very difficult for amateur users to use.
Due to the difficulty users had creating valid designs, we completely
overhauled our interface to focus on keeping the user's design in a
valid state. In our final interface, users cannot add an element to a
sketch that will cause it to become invalid. Along with a system that
validates cuts and folds before adding them to the sketch, our modular
tools help ensure validity. Rather than individual cuts and folds, our
tools create modular folding units, which solve geometric constraints
transparently and display an interactive preview of edges during feature
creation. Although we considered a system based on automatically
correcting the user's arbitrary folds and cuts, we believe our
tools-based system allows for a similar level of creativity, while
guaranteeing a valid pop-up card.
