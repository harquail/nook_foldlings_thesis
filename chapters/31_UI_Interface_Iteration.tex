We started development in Fall 2014, as the final project for a course
on Computational Fabrication at Dartmouth. By December 2014, we had a
functional prototype of our popup card design software. Users could
create cuts and folds and fabricate them using a laser cutter. However,
in many ways our software was no better than manually creating cards. In
order to create a valid and beautiful design, users needed some prior
knowledge. Performance problems also hampered users' ability to create
designs. Our goal was to improve both of these aspects of Foldlings
dramatically, to arrive at an intuitive and functional tool. Paper
mockups were an integral part of our design process. We used these paper
mockups to drive interface development, and also to quickly get feedback
from users before investing development resources\footnote{See Appendix
  X: for samples of paper mockups we created during the design process}.

In arriving at our final design, we iterated through several potential
designs, each time getting feedback through informal user studies. We
made many changes to the toolset and experience based on feedback from
users. The final approach is ``feature-based'' --- in other words, the
user creates multiple cuts and folds in a single action, rather than
individually. These discrete logical units allow the user to design more
quickly, and to combine multiple different feature types to create
complex designs. A key advantage to this design over a less structured
approach is modularity. This is both an algorithmic and an interface
advantage: our algorithms benefit from collecting cuts and folds into
discrete logical units, and the user benefits from a faster and more
structured design process.

Throughout the development process, we collected feedback through
informal user tests. One test we performed involved presenting a
partially-implemented version of our software to users. The majority of
buttons were functional --- erase, cut, fold, and and tab, but our
interface also contained buttons for unimplemented features. The primary
goals were to test whether our existing tools were useful and to collect
feedback on potential new features for Foldlings. When a user tapped a
button that we had not yet implemented, we asked them to describe how
they thought the tool would work, and talked with them about the
behavior the button represented.

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    title=User Reactions to Alpha,
    ybar,
    enlargelimits=0.15,
    x=0.8cm,
    legend style={at={(0.5,-0.2)},
      anchor=north,legend columns=-1},
    ylabel={participants},
    symbolic x coords={new sketch,saved sketch,erase,fold,cut,tab,track,mirror,send to laser,print,wanted mirror,wanted track,wanted slider},
    xtick=data,
    nodes near coords, 
    nodes near coords align={vertical},
    x tick label style={rotate=45,anchor=east},
    ]
    \addplot coordinates {(new sketch,14)(saved sketch,15)(erase,15)(fold,16)(cut,16)(tab,14)(track,10)(mirror,13)(send to laser,16)(print,16)(wanted mirror,12)(wanted track,2)(wanted slider,2)};
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

In the graph above, the first ten labels indicate the number of
participants who tapped a button. The last three labels --- starting
with ``wanted mirror,'' show responses to unimplemented tools. To
calculate these numbers, we asked first users to describe what they
thought the button would do, and then gauged their reaction as we
described our vision for that tool. The tally represents a qualitative
measure of whether the user was enthusiastic about the feature or had a
more negative response. Some negative responses include confusion about
the tool's purpose and statements such as ``I don't think I would want
to use that.''

From this test, we learned that the track and slider tools were
confusing, and that novice users were generally not interested in
creating features that require multiple pieces of paper.

As users created sketches using our software, we also took notes on
their experience and collected suggestions for improvements. Although
only a small fraction of the features requested by users are implemented
in the final app, the feedback from these early user tests set us on the
path toward feature-based design. A common theme among the observation
in Table 1.1 is the difficulty in creating valid sketches and confusion
about the proposed track and slider tools.

A common theme among the feature requests was a desire for a more
complete tutorial and explanation of tools. Features only appear once in
Table 1.2, even if they were requested by multiple people. The
most-requested feature was an interactive tutorial, requested by 4 (of
16) users. In the final version of our software, we display short
example videos when users use a tool for the first time
\textbf{\textgreater{}\textgreater{}TODO:REF}. These tutorials allow
users to quickly get started quickly with minimal interruptions.
