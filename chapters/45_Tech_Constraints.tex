\section{Constraints on Fold
Features}\label{constraints-on-fold-features}

Constraints are central to the implementation of Foldlings' algorithms,
which help our software provide an accurate preview of sketches, and
ensure that designs created with Foldlings will fold correctly. As an
educational tool, one of the primary benefits of our software might be
the development of an intuitive understanding of the limits of paper.

\subsection{Geometric Constraints}\label{geometric-constraints}

Several geometric constraints drive Foldling's algorithms. These
constraints are the core reason for the difficulty of creating designs
manually; a key advantage of our system is that these constraints are
resolved automatically.

\subsubsection{Box Fold}\label{box-fold}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics{figures/45_Tech_Constraints/boxfoldConstraints.pdf}
\caption{Geometric constraints for box fold features}
\end{figure}

A box fold is constrained by a relationship between its folds. Given a
top fold and bottom fold at fixed height, with a driving fold with a
height between the other two folds, the vertical distance between the
bottom fold and the driving fold must be equal to the distance between
the top fold and the middle fold of the feature (see figure 3.9).

This 90-degree angle constraint applies equally to freeform and polygon
features (at least, those that span a fold).

\subsubsection{Freeform}\label{freeform}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{figures/45_Tech_Constraints/freeformConstraints.pdf}
\caption{Geometric constraints for freeform features}
\end{figure}

Freeform fold heights are calculated similarly to those in a box fold.
After performing truncation\footnote{Described in section
  \ref{tool-implementation}, \nameref{tool-implementation}, on page
  \pageref{tool-implementation}.} to place the top and bottom folds of
the freeform shape, we apply the 90-degree constraint to place the
middle fold in the feature. Of course, holes are not bound by this
constraint, because they do not have a driving fold (see figure 3.10).

As with all features, validity constraints are separate from geometric
constraints. Freeform shapes that intersect themselves do not have a
place for the middle fold, but by performing validity checks before
solving for geometric constraints, we avoid many problems and edge cases
that would otherwise occur.

\subsubsection{Polygon}\label{polygon}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{figures/45_Tech_Constraints/polygonConstraints.pdf}
\caption{Geometric constraints for polygon features}
\end{figure}

The same constraints that apply to freeform shape apply to polygons.
Although the edges are constructed differently, polygons are essentially
a subset of freeform shapes, composed only of straight lines (see figure
3.11).

\subsubsection{V-Fold}\label{v-fold}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{figures/45_Tech_Constraints/vfoldConstraints.pdf}
\caption{Geometric constraints for freeform features}
\end{figure}

Although a v-fold also folds from zero to 180 degrees with the card, its
planes moves at non-orthogonal angles. The constraint on v-fold features
is therefore based on angle rather than height.

The simplest case of v-folds --- and the one most popularly constructed
by our user testers using manual methods --- is a symmetric v-fold. In
this case, the top and bottom angles of the fold are equal. The shape
approximates an isosceles triangle.

In the more complex case, the angles between the two diagonal folds and
the driving fold differ. Andrew Glassner demonstrates that for any
``single slit mechanism,'' the angle from the driving fold to either the
top or bottom fold must be equal to the angle between the opposite fold
and the middle fold (\citet{glassner1998interactive}, 3). This
constraint is only solvable if the sum of the angles between each
diagonal fold and driving fold is less than 180 degrees. Intuitively,
this constraint is not dissimilar from the constraint for box folds ---
the position of the middle fold is constrained by the driving fold's
relationship to the top and bottom folds (see figure 3.12).

\subsection{Physical Constraints}\label{physical-constraints}

In addition, the physicality of paper places constraints on where cuts
and folds can be placed. Depending on the manufacture method, there is
some minimum line length that can be cut or folded, and some minimum
distance folds and cuts must be apart. These depend on a number of
variables ranging from paper thickness to manufacture method (for
example, laser cutters have a higher tolerance for closely-drawn lines).
Even within a specific technology, there is also a wide variation in
cutting precision.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{figures/45_Tech_Constraints/tooclosecuts.jpg}
\caption{A malformed laser-cut fold. This is supposed to be a dotted
line, but because the dots were too close together, they have merged to
become a single cut.}
\end{figure}

In our software, we take this into account by incorporating a minimum
edge length constraint. The minimum edge length is the minimum length
for all edges in a feature. If the user creates a feature with edges
less than this length, a warning will appear as described in section see
Chapter \ref{tool-interactions}, section \ref{warnings-and-errors},
Warnings and Errors, on page \pageref{warnings-and-errors}, and the
feature will not be added to the sketch. This length constraint solves a
variety of potential problems: it prevents users from creating features
that are too small to tap, and insures that edges can be easily cut by
hand or using automated methods. We use the same length as the minimum
edge distance. In order to be valid, all edges in a feature must be at
least this distance from all other edges. In addition, we the line
pattern for folds in the SVG output to prevent the problem shown in
figure 3.13. Because the fold line pattern must be easy to crease while
maintaining the card's integrity, there is a tradeoff between ease of
folding (dots close together) and durability (dot further apart). We
adjusted the line pattern to consist of short dots spaced out slightly
further than the minimum edge distance. Although we discovered the line
pattern through experimentation, it performs well on multiple laser
cutters, paper types, and manual cutting. This pattern should work well
for most common paper cutting methods.
