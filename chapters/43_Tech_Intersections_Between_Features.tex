As we observed at the Digital Arts Exhibition\footnote{See section
  chapter \textbf{\textgreater{}\textgreater{}TODO}}, users often
attempt to draw features that overlap with existing features in the
sketch.

Our intersection . This is a complex problem, and is only partly
implemented\footnote{One} due to the complexity involved in adding
intersections to our system. Currently, we display an error message if
the intersected feature will be left with any folds less than the
minimum edge length. A more complete implementation would .
